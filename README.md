# HTTP Server
This server comes with CRUD access to a JSON file system.

### Modules

This module uses the _bad-store_ module for CRUD. As such it you must include a valid name key:value pair. _Express_ is handling the routing for the server. Built in modules are not listed.

### Testing

Currently the CRUD operations function as intended. Mocha/Chai-http testing is in-progress.

### Credit

I have largely rewritten and modified the work of Marty N for this project.
